* User onboarding (Sign In / Sign Up)
* PDF upload, preview, rename, deletion
* Interactive note-chat interface
* Dashboard with metrics
* Seamless Vapi interview client

### **Database Layer**

* **PostgreSQL** stores:

  * Users
  * PDFs
  * Chat sessions
  * Messages
  * Metadata

### **Vector Search Layer**
